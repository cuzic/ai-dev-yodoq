# Overflow Detection Bugs - Fixed

## Bugs Identified and Fixed

### 1. **CSS Code Treated as Slide Content** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Lines like `section.three-column h1` were flagged as overflow
**Fix:** Added `is_css_or_style_line()` function to detect and skip CSS/YAML
**Result:** Reduced false positives from 60 to 31 lines

### 2. **Emoji Character Width Incorrect** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Emojis (📍) counted as 1x Japanese character (16px)
**Reality:** Emojis are typically 1.5x wider than regular characters
**Fix:** Added emoji detection (Unicode ranges 0x1F300-0x1F9FF, etc.)
**Result:** More accurate width calculation for emoji-heavy slides

### 3. **Layout Detection False Positives** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Substring matching could match unintended patterns
**Fix:** Use regex to extract exact `<!-- _class: X -->` directive
**Result:** Precise layout detection, no false matches

### 4. **Style Blocks Not Skipped** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Content between `<style>` tags analyzed as slide text
**Fix:** Track `in_style_block` state and skip all lines within
**Result:** Eliminated ~20 false positives from CSS blocks

### 5. **"Untitled" Slides Included in Count** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** CSS/style slides without titles counted as real slides
**Fix:** Filter out "Untitled" slides from final report
**Result:** Clear separation between real content and infrastructure slides
